An Inscryption mod that adds a talking Raven card into Act 1 and Kaycee's Mod.
Irons can be found via. random card draws or trader's inventories. 
I'd like to add her as a static encounter, like the other talking cards, but until I learn how that is unavaliable.

Irons (Raven) has unique lore, animated portraits, a unique voice pitch, and unique dialogue for nearly every in-game situational (excluding between-cards conversations, e.g. Stoat and Stinkbug talking to each other)

In addition, this mod also adds 2 starter decks:
| Name            | Cards                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fliers          | Raven (Talking), Raven, Sparrow, Sparrow, Bat              |
| Trash Animals   | Raven (Talking), Ringworm, Raccoon, Bat, Magpie, Opossum   |


# Installation
This modâ€™s dependencies are BepInEx, the InscryptionAPI, JSONCardLoader, Jackalope and TalkingCardAPI.


### KNOWN ISSUES
- Card clips the edges of the card's borders. Unfixable until further notice (as in, until I find the correct aspect ratio.)
- DOES NOT function with Orochi_Umbra's amazing NodeBane mod, unfortunately.
